**Inspiration:** Millions of people every day leave their homes unaware of the amount of power that they use.
<br>
**What it does:** Real-time tracking/reporting of power usage using original tech and novel software applications.
<br>
**How we built it:** We used SolidWorks to design the power adapter prototype that measures power usage of appliances. 
Additionally, we have developed an app user-interface with a functional algorithm calculating real-time energy usage.
<br>
**What's next for Conscious Energy:** Thinking of new ideas and helping others with our skills the best that we can!
