# Eye Care Event - Champaign, IL (9/25/2022)

As president of the ophthalmology club, I organized the health care booth providing vision screening for the underserved of Champaign, IL. Students practiced their patient communication skills by having screening and prevention discussions with individuals who do not have easy access to healthcare.
<br>
<br>
The service learning opportunity was a great experience where 
I could utilize our resources and team from the ophthalmology interest group to provide 
basic eye exams to the underserved in Champaign, Illinois.
<br>
<br>
During my service-learning experience, I learned how to communicate effectively with individuals in an underserved community regarding the importance of maintaining 
regular medical appointments. As a future physician, I hope to volunteer with underserved communities; this opportunity allowed me to experience the 
environment and challenges that may be present there.
