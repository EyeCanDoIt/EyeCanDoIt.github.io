# Eye Care Event - Champaign, IL

The service learning opportunity was a great experience where 
I could utilize our resources and team from the ophthalmology interest group to provide 
basic eye exams to the underserved in Champaign, Illinois.
<br>
As president of the ophthalmology club, I organized the health care booth offering eye examinations in an organized fashion. Students practiced their patient 
communication skills by having screening and prevention discussions with potentially underserved individuals who do not have easy access to healthcare.
<br>
During my service-learning experience, I learned how to communicate effectively with individuals in an underserved community regarding the importance of maintaining 
regular medical appointments. As a future physician, I hope to volunteer with underserved communities; this opportunity allowed me to experience the 
environment and challenges that may be present there.
