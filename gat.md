# Goldmann Applanation Tonometry Simulator

[Gatsim.com](https://ryerrabelli.github.io/TonometrySimulation/src/v004/){:target="_blank"}

Measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) is critical for the management of glaucoma. Present day training requires a courageous volunteer to act as a patient. 
Physical models acting as artificial globes have been developed for training but require materials that may not be easily accessible and have associated costs.


We developed an online application which mimics the steps of GAT and is free to use for trainees
at gatsim.com. Trainees can now train on our model before seeing patients, which may ultimately improve
outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first time ever an online simulation of Goldmann Applanation
Tonometry has been developed. This will allow individuals to train and learn the mechanics of GAT via an
easy-to-use online application. We hope such technology will improve the skills of trainees, hasten the time
to reach expertise, and minimize potential patient complications.
