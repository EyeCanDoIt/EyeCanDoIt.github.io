[Master's Thesis: Pharmacologic profiling of novel compounds via fluorometric analyses of monoamine transporter responses]
(https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5983/){:target="_blank"} (Thesis release date: July 18, 2024).

<br>

I utilized a unique fluorescent analysis technique to explore three therapeutic compounds of interest (in-vitro) which contain structural similarity to 
fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor).

<br>

My assays allowed me to measure selectivity of these novel compounds at the monoamine transporters (SERT, DAT, and NET) and ultimately classify each based off of their
selectivity profiles.

I then developed [OPOMed](https://ashkhan.net/opomed){:target="_blank"}, a theoretical personalized medicine approach for users 
to upload brain PET scans for determination of the best psychopharmacologic treatment option.
