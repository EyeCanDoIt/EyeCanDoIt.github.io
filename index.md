# Hi! I'm Ashkhan

I am a fourth-year medical student at the [Carle Illinois College of Medicine](https://medicine.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"},
the world's first engineering medical school.

My professional interests include combining my computer science, biomaterials, pharmacology, and ophthalmology skills to develop innovative biomedical engineering solutions for the eye-care community. I am passionate about volunteer work and charitable causes, especially those that help people with vision problems. I am also interested in developing interactive educational experiences through software design so that students can learn in new and exciting ways. Finally, I want to build a practice where I spend sufficient time listening and caring for my patients.

Thanks for visiting my website!
